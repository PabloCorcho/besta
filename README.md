# 

This package, inspired on [HBSPS](https://github.com/mdries/HBSPS) (Hierarchical Bayesian Stellar Population Synthesis), performs the modelling and fitting of spectra by modelling the Star Formation History (SFH) of galaxies...

# Contents

The package primarily relies on two main libraries.

## Population Synthesis Toolkit

Used to perform the synthesis of stellar populations in a highly-flexible framework.

## [Cosmosis](https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

A library for Monte Carlo sampling for parameter estimation.
